// Gilberto is a famous sfiha vendor. However, although everyone likes his sfihas, he can only give the change with two different bills, i.e., it's not always possible to get the right change. In order to make Gil's life easier, write a program for him to check whether it's possible to give the exact change using two different bills.

// Available bills: 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100.
// Input

// The input contains an integer N representing the buy price and then an integer M representing the price paid by the costumer (N < M ≤ 104). Read input until N = M = 0.
// Output

// Print "possible" if it's possible to give the exact change or "impossible" if it's not.



// Write an algorithm to read a value A and a value N. Print the sum of N numbers from A (inclusive). While N is negative or ZERO, a new N (only N) must be read. All input values are in the same line.
// Input

// The input contains only integer values, ​​can be positive or negative.
// Output

// The output contains only an integer value.
// Input Sample 	Output Sample

// 3 2
	

// 7

// 3 -1 0 -2 2
